# Develop and Analyze Model Consumer Behavior

Mobile operator Megaline is dissatisfied because many of their customers are still using old packages. The company wants to develop a model that can analyze consumer behavior and recommend one of the two new Megaline packages: Smart or Ultra.

You have access to data on the behavior of customers who have switched to the latest package (from the Statistical Data Analysis course project). In this classification task, you need to develop a model that is able to select the right packets. Now that you have completed the data pre-processing steps, you can proceed directly to the modeling stage.
Develop a model that has the highest possible accuracy. In this project, the threshold for the accuracy level is 0.75. Check your model's accuracy metrics using a test dataset.
